<H2>YAJOGLB Technical overview</H2>
<P>This page gives a brief technical overview of YAJOGLB (Yet Another
Java OpenGL Binding) that describes the development environment used
and the package that is supplied.</P> <H3>The Development
Environment</H3>
<P>YAJOGLB was developed in an environment that can most charitably
described as <I>strange</I>. It's mostly a combination of tools that
have been ported from Unix to Windows NT, with some Microsoft software
thrown in. Originally I tried to write the binding using version b19
of <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat's</A>'s <A
HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</A>
project. Everything worked fine until I tried to write native methods
that returned Java objects instead of Java primitives. When I tried to
return Java objects, the JVM crashed. Symantec's native compiler
wasn't very happy with the code that gcc generated either. After
trying to get things to work, I broke down and started using
Microsoft's Visual C++ V6.0, which made things much better. There are
still traces of Cygnus's code in the distribution though.</P>
<P>However, I continue to use Cygwin's make and bash for the Java code.</P>

<P>At first I used RCS to maintain the files.  However, I RCS doesn't
support file renaming, so I switched to CVS.  I had hoped to use a
single common repository for Linux and Windows, but that did not work
out.  I tried placing the repository on a FAT32 partition that was
shared by Linux and Windows; there were lots of case problems.  If
anyone has a single machine solution that works please send me some
email.

<P>Using the Cygnus tools under Windows does have one advantage:
shifting my development work to Linux is trivial.  </P>

<H3>The package</H3>
<P>There are only a couple of classes in the package, each with a well-defined purpose. First I will describe the public classes, and later on I will get into the gory details.</P>

<P>There are also some private classes that go along with the
package. The most obvious are the ones that look like they come from
Sun. Prior to the JAWT library in JDK 1.3 there was no way to get to
the device context and window pointer for a particular AWT Canvas
object under Microsoft Windows or X11. </P> 

<P>The sun.awt.windows.WindowspDataAccess and
sun.awt.windows.X11pDataAccess duplicate JAWT's functionality, and are
included in case you want to compile the binding with a JDK prior to
JDK 1.3. By default they will not be used, and the binding will be
built using JAWT. Placing the two classes under the Sun hierarchy
allows the binding to get at the private AWT windowing
information. It's also extremely non-portable.  But prior to the JAWT,
there was no portable way to get the windowing information.  The only
"clean" way was to implement your own windowing support, which is a
lot of work.  In fact, that's what I foolishly tried to do for my
first implementation. </P>

some private classes and public interfaces inside of the package

<a NAME=building></a><H2>How to build it</H2> 

<p>It is easy to build the distribution under Linux.  First, make sure
that you have GNU gcc (for the native library), a Java software
development kit (for the Java side) and python (for C dependency
generation) installed.  In the top level directory type
<code>make</code>.  You should see the python depend script run for
all of the C files first.  The C files that depend on the Java native
headers will not be able to find the native headers; you can safely
ignore the warnings.  Next the Java code will be compiled and the
native headers will be generated.  The last thing that will happen is
that the C code will be compiled and the YAJOGLB native library will
be built in the distribution's top level directory.

</p>
<p>
Under windows things are a bit harder.  You need to make sure that
cygwin is installed for the make command that Visual C++ is installed
for the C compiler.  The Java software development kit also needs to
be installed, so that you can generate native header files and compile
the java code.  Then, in the top level directory type <code>make -k
NATIVEHEADERS</code>.  You will see a large number of errors for the
native code, which you can safely ignore, because you are only using
the make to generate the native header files.  Once the native header
files have been generated you can build the native library with Visual
C++ (the project files are included, but you will probably need to
change some of the include directories).  The library will be placed
in the Release or Debug directory, depending on what you ask Visual
C++ to compile.  Their is a target in the Makefile named allJava that
will build all of the Java source.

<H2>Getting Started</H2>
<P>This section describes how to write the simplest possible OpenGL
code using the binding (which is stored in the test directory as
Simplest.java) We'll call the class Simplest. It will extend Canvas
and implement GLConstants (for ease of access to OpenGL's
constants). There are a few instance variables, and I've omitted
accessor methods in the interest of simplicity:</P> <PRE>private
Context context; private GL gl = new GL(); private GLU glu = new
GLU();</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Context is used to hold the OpenGL context that we'll create for
our rendering; gl and glu are the objects that all of our OpenGL and
GLU calls will be made through. Notice that while we create the gl and
glu objects inline, we delay the context creation.</P>
<P>The Canvas class provides a method that is called once an Canvas
has been setup for OpenGL rendering. It is called glInit(), and it's a
good place to actually create the OpenGL context that the canvas
object will use, and to perform any persistent matrix settings. </P>
<P>The first two lines create the OpenGL context, tying it to this
specific Canvas, and make it the current context for the currently
active thread. The created context will have all of its values taken
from defaults set by the OpenGL package. The only one that really
concerns us here is that the default OpenGL context has double
buffering enabled. That will affect the paint() method described
further below. We also make the na&iuml;ve assumption that only one
thread is performing rendering on Simplest, and will not bother with
locking the context. The rest of the method sets up the viewing
matrices and other OpenGL state that we will need for rendering.</P>
<PRE>public void glInit() { context = new Context(this);
context.makeCurrent(this);
    
    /* Make sure that we use our depth buffer. */
    gl.enable(DEPTH_TEST);

    /* Position our viewer. */
    gl.matrixMode(MODELVIEW);
    gl.translate(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f);
    
    /* Set up the viewing projection. */
    gl.matrixMode(PROJECTION);
    gl.frustum(-1.0f, 1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f, 1.5f, 12.0f); 
    glu.gluLookAt(0.0f, 0.0f, -4.0f, 
                  0.0f, 0.0f, -3.0f, 
                  0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f); 
    gl.color(0.0, 1.0, 0.0); 
}</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>All of the actual rendering is done in the paint() method, which is
called as needed by Canvas.  Our method clears the canvas's display
and depth buffer, and then draws a single triangle. The very last
thing it does is exchange our display buffer with our rendering
buffer, so that the user can see the triangle.</P> <PRE>public void
paint() { gl.clear(COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

    /* Draw a single triangle. */
    gl.begin(TRIANGLES);
    gl.vertex(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    gl.vertex(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    gl.vertex(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
    gl.end();

    swapBuffers();
  }</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>We also need a static main function to start things up. Here is what it looks like:</P>
<PRE>public static void main(String args[]) {
    Simplest      simplest = new Simplest();
    Frame         frame    = new Frame();

    frame.setLayout(new GridLayout(1,1));
    frame.add(simplest);
    frame.setTitle("The simplest possible OpenGL binding demo.");
    frame.pack();
    frame.setSize(new Dimension(400,400));
    frame.setBackground(java.awt.Color.black);
    frame.setVisible(true);
  }
}</PRE>
<P>The method simply creates a frame with a single object in it: an
instance of our Simplest class. Everything else will be handled by the
normal flow of events for a canvas object. The class makes no attempts
to deal with input, so there is no way to exit the program other than
hitting control-c! Lastly, here is a screenshot of the window when it
pops up on the screen:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Simplest.jpg" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=400 ALT="Picture of a triangle"></P>

<P>
You can only perform OpenGL operations while the Canvas is locked.
This is handled automatically for you inside of the paint() and
glInit() methods.  If you need to perform OpenGL operations outside of
those two methods you'll need to execute them via the Canvas's
lockedMethod method.  Unfortunetly there are some required component
methods, like componentResized, that you will have to support this
way.  Here is a sketch from the GeometryViewer of what you need to do.
<P>

In your constructor use reflection to get the method to call for a
resize event, which is handled by componentResized.

<PRE>
class GeometryViewer {
  Method resizedMethod;
  GeometryViewer() {
      ...
      resizedMethod = getClass().getMethod("lockedComponentResized", 
					   parameterTypes);
      ...
  }
  ...
  // This gets invoked when the component is resized.
  public void componentResized(ComponentEvent e) {
    lockedMethod(resizedMethod, this, null);
  }
  // This gets called by lockedMethod.
  public void lockedComponentResized(Object arg) {
    // Handle the resize.
  }
}
</PRE>

<H3>To do</H3>
<ul>
<li>Fix the Java builds in the Makefile --- it is not taking advantage of the fact that javac will automatically rebuild dependencies.
<li>Add a subclass for GeometryViewer that gracefully handles animations.
<li>Replace the current platform dependent thread and environment methods with the JNI methods that were added to support getting to a JVM from a thread.
</ul>
