INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

Linux and Solaris
-----------------

You will have to make a few edits so that the Makefiles can find your
Java installation.  If you are using Linux edit config-linux.mk, and
make sure that JNI_GENERIC_HEADERS and JNI_SPECIFIC_HEADERS point to
the appropriate location on your file systems.  These variables are
used so that the native library can find the jawt.h and jawt_md.h
header files.  If you are using Solaris edit config-solaris.mk
instead.

If you are using Linux you will also need to edit the mklib.linux and
mklib.solaris scripts.  In each case, modify the EXTRALIBS variable to
include the directory where the jawt library can be found.
