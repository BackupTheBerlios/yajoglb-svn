<H2>YAJOGLB Linux Notes</H2>
<P>
This page describes some of the problems that I ran into getting the
bindings to work under <A HREF="http://www.debian.org">Debian
GNU/Linux 2.0</A>, with the <A
HREF="http://www.blackdown.org">Blackdown 1.1.7-1a</A> Java port.  If
you are using a later version of Debian or the Blackdown port you
should have no problems.  My current work environment,
which consists of Debian 2.2r2, JDK 1.3 and the NVIDIA OpenGL drivers,
is problem free.
</P>
<P>
You'll need to have <A HREF="http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net">Mesa</A>
or some other OpenGL implementation installed on your system before
you can even compile the bindings.  However, you have to be careful
about how you compile Mesa if you want to write a multi-threaded Java
application.  Since it's almost impossible to NOT write a
multi-threaded Java application, you probably care, even if you think
that you don't.  I recommend Mesa's linux-386-pthread-shared
configuration.
</P>
<P>
The Debian Mesa package doesn't appear to have been compiled with
threads in mind.  That means you'll have to get and compile Mesa on
your own, if you want things to work properly.  It is also important
that you use the native threads package that comes with the Blackdown
distribution.  I've ran into Mesa problems that were caused by mixing
green threads with native threads.
</P>
<P>
You can test things out with the Concurrence example inside the test
directory.  It will try to open up two windows, and then try to
perform some animations in both at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier versions of Mesa did not have the latest and greatest GLU
functions (it now does).  Use of unsupported functions will result in
an UnsupportedMethodException being thrown.
